Exploit script to get access to gamepass perks for free in CS:RNG

# Note
This script is a little worse than the casino script but it is more functional.

## Overview

This script allows the user to get access to gamepass perks in CS:RNG.

## Features

- **Key System**: Users can get a key to activate the script.
- **Access to Gamepass Perks without owning it**: Just at the press of a button you can get what other people have to pay for without owning it.
- **User-Friendly UI**: UI to control settings. Not pretty - But the code is cleaner and functional.
- **Script Termination**: Easily stop the script and remove the GUI when desired.

## How It Works

Upon execution, the script displays a GUI with options to toggle enabled / disabled for each gamepass:

- **Toggles**: Toggles the gamepass on / off. The buttons are pretty self-explanitory.
- **FastSpin**: After toggling FastSpin, unlike with the other ones that automatically turn on. You'll have to go press the button in-game thats next to the Roll button.
- **Destroy**: Terminates the script and removes the GUI from the screen.

## Usage

1. **Execution**: Run the script in CS:RNG.

## Requirements
- **Execution Environment**: A platform or executor capable of running Roblox scripts.

## Disclaimer
- **This Script is not Free**: Believe it or not, I want to get paid for the work I have done. Thus, access to this script is paid. It's cheaper than access to Deepwoken though.
- **Educational Purposes**: This script is intended for educational purposes only.
- **Use at Your Own Risk**: The use of exploits violates Roblox's terms of service. Use this script responsibly and at your own risk.
- **No Warranty**: The script is provided "as-is" without any warranty. The creator is not responsible for any consequences arising from its use.
